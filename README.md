Main function:  An inconsistency-driven O&M paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable and decision-oriented guidance via large language model–based semantic reasoning.

The source data and code are still under refinement and will be fully organized and uploaded to the GitHub repository upon completion of the work.
