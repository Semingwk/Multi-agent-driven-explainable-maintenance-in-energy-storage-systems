# Initial SOC deviation induces “V-type” or “Λ-type” voltage inconsistency with sharp end-of-discharge deviation  
Different initial SOCs in series cells cause MN curves with “V-type” features for higher initial SOC and “Λ-type” features for lower initial SOC during charge. Voltage deviation grows with SOC deviation (e.g., 5–10% SOC offset) and is strongly amplified near low and high SOC, giving a sharp MN increase or decrease at the end of discharge while CCV remains relatively stable over a few cycles. These patterns arise from lateral shifting of the voltage–SOC curve so the specific cell is at a different reaction stage, and inconsistency is largest at SOC extremes.

# Capacity deviation stretches voltage–SOC curves and mimics SOC-driven “V-type/Λ-type” features  
Cells with lower capacity have a narrower usable SOC window and are more easily charged to higher SOC or discharged to lower SOC, generating “Λ-type” or “V-type” MN patterns and sharp deviation at the end of discharge similar to initial SOC deviation. Compared with SOC offset, capacity-induced sharp-fall features are more gradual because they result from stretching/shortening of the voltage–SOC curve rather than pure horizontal shift. For capacity offsets on the order of ~225–450 mAh in ~2.6 Ah cells, CCV stays nearly constant over several cycles, indicating static heterogeneity rather than a progressive fault.

# SOC- vs capacity-driven inconsistency can be distinguished by SOC-interval signatures  
Initial SOC differences mainly cause a lateral movement of the voltage–SOC curve so inconsistency is stronger and more symmetric at both low and high SOC regions. Capacity deviation mainly alters the intensity of inconsistency in different SOC regions via stretching or compressing the curve, typically giving weaker low/high-SOC deviation than pure SOC offset. Comparing MN or deviation scatter across SOC intervals can therefore separate SOC-shift–dominated inconsistency from capacity-stretch–dominated inconsistency.

# Magnitude of SOC and capacity variation controls intensity of voltage inconsistency features  
Larger SOC or capacity deviations produce more pronounced “V/Λ-type” MN shapes, sharper end-of-discharge drops, and higher CCV values. In practical packs, combined moderate deviations in SOC and capacity can yield inconsistency signatures comparable in magnitude to a single strong deviation in one of these parameters. Thus, quantifying the amplitude of MN and CCV provides indirect information about the severity of underlying property variation.

# Internal resistance increase causes symmetric charge–discharge voltage deviation independent of SOC  
Increasing a cell’s internal resistance (e.g., by 80–150 mΩ) yields higher voltage during charge and lower voltage during discharge compared with other cells, while rest voltages remain aligned. The MN deviation is nearly SOC-independent and its magnitude scales with the resistance increase, and CCV is larger but remains stable over multiple cycles. This behavior reflects a pure ohmic IR-drop effect without progressive degradation in the short observation window.

# Internal resistance decrease (ISC-like) yields progressively growing low-voltage deviation and CCV  
Emulated internal short circuits (e.g., parallel resistors of 57–100 Ω) continuously consume charge and keep the affected cell at lower SOC than others. The cell voltage is lower than others throughout operation, MN becomes more negative cycle by cycle, and CCV increases approximately linearly over at least several cycles. This continuous MN decline and monotonic CCV growth are characteristic signatures of ISC-type resistance decrease faults rather than static resistance differences.

# Over-discharge to −5% to −15% SOC only induces minor short-term voltage inconsistency  
Two over-discharge cycles to −5%, −10%, or −15% SOC cause <1% capacity loss and <1 mΩ resistance increase at the cell level. In subsequent module cycling, the affected cell shows only small low-voltage deviation at discharge end, with MN in a narrow range around zero and CCV stabilizing near a very low value after a few cycles. Short-term over-discharge at these levels therefore produces limited and quasi-steady voltage inconsistency, although longer-term effects are not captured.

# Over-discharge and low-temperature abuse produce small CCV but visible end-of-discharge drops  
Even when CCV remains low for over-discharge and brief low-temperature operation, the affected cell exhibits a sharp voltage drop at the end of discharge and low rest voltage relative to others. These localized end-of-discharge features persist despite small pack-level inconsistency indicators. Thus, relying only on scalar CCV can miss early-stage damage that is evident in detailed end-of-discharge voltage and MN traces.

# Mechanical deformation above ~6.5 mm indentation triggers ISC-like progressive inconsistency  
Radial indentation beyond roughly 6.5 mm (e.g., 6.8 mm with a small punch) reduces cell capacity by about 40–60 mAh while average resistance changes remain below ~2 mΩ. The indented cell shows slightly higher voltage near the end of charge but becomes the lowest-voltage cell in discharge, with end-of-discharge deviation and negative MN growing with cycle count. CCV increases gradually, mirroring the ISC case and indicating deformation-induced internal short or leakage paths.

# Mechanical deformation produces “V-type” MN and sharp fall at discharge from capacity loss and SOC shift  
Indentation damage reduces usable capacity and introduces ongoing SOC loss via ISC-like behavior, so the damaged cell tends toward higher effective SOC in charge and lower SOC in discharge. As a result, MN exhibits a “V-type” feature during charging and a sharp fall at the end of discharge, with these features becoming more pronounced for deeper indentation (e.g., ≥6.8 mm). The combination of V-type charge behavior, sharp discharge-end fall, and cycle-wise MN decline is a distinctive mechanical-abuse voltage signature.

# Overcharge above 120–130% SOC accelerates capacity loss, raises resistance, and amplifies voltage inconsistency  
Two overcharge cycles at 110–140% SOC show that capacity remains nearly unchanged below about 120% SOC but drops by more than ~2% once SOC exceeds ~130%. The cell’s resistance is almost unchanged at 110% SOC but increases by several milliohms at 120%, 130%, and 140% SOC, with resistance increment roughly proportional to overcharge level. In later module cycling, overcharged cells show high-voltage deviation during charge and lowest voltage at discharge end, with V-type MN features and sharper end-of-discharge drops at higher overcharge degrees.

# Overcharge inconsistency evolves as low initial SOC counteracts capacity-loss “V-type” signature  
In the first post-overcharge cycle, the overcharged cell shows a clear V-type MN pattern due mainly to capacity loss and polarization increase. From the second cycle onward, its initial SOC is lower than that of normal cells, adding a low-SOC Λ-type effect that opposes the original V-type signature. Consequently, the V-type feature weakens or disappears with cycling, CCV decreases after the first cycle, and then stabilizes at a lower value, illustrating how evolving initial SOC can mask capacity-driven inconsistency.

# Low-temperature cycling at −10°C reduces capacity and slightly increases resistance with rate-dependent inconsistency  
Three cycles at −10°C cause capacity to drop by about 2–3% (tens to a little over 100 mAh depending on C-rate) and increase ohmic resistance by up to roughly 1.2 mΩ. After such low-temperature exposure, at 0.5C the abused cell charges at a higher voltage (≈20 mV) than others and then shows a notable voltage drop in discharge, while at 1C and 1.5C it starts with lower initial SOC and its voltage gradually falls below others during discharge. These inconsistencies are consistent with lithium-plating–induced capacity fade and modest resistance growth, accentuated at higher C-rates.

# “V-type” low-temperature feature attenuates at higher C-rates while end-of-discharge deviation intensifies  
At −10°C and 0.5C, MN shows a pronounced V-type pattern during charge and then drops to around −0.02 during discharge, indicating high voltage in charge and mild low-voltage deviation later. At 1C and 1.5C, the V-type shape becomes weak, but MN at the end of discharge falls further (e.g., roughly −0.04 to −0.05), as low initial SOC and capacity fade dominate. CCV remains below about 0.0022 after a few cycles, indicating modest overall inconsistency, but sharp end-of-discharge voltage drops and low rest voltage are strong local indicators of low-temperature damage.

# Mean normalization (MN) provides a signed, SOC-resolved cell-level inconsistency indicator  
MN is defined from each cell’s voltage relative to the pack average and maximum cell voltage, giving positive values for cells above average and negative for cells below. Larger absolute MN indicates greater instantaneous voltage deviation, and its SOC dependence encodes shapes such as V-type, Λ-type, sharp end-of-discharge fall, or continuous decline over cycles. Because MN preserves sign and SOC resolution, it is well suited for extracting subtle inconsistency patterns and differentiating charge vs discharge behavior for each cell.

# Coefficient of consistency variation (CCV) captures pack-level inconsistency severity over the charge period  
CCV is computed from the time-resolved mean absolute voltage difference across cells during charge and normalized by the average pack charging voltage, yielding a single scalar measure of pack consistency. Higher CCV corresponds to poorer voltage consistency, and its evolution over cycles distinguishes static parameter scatter (nearly constant CCV) from progressive faults such as ISC (monotonically rising CCV). Compared with standard deviation–based indicators, CCV based on mean difference better reflects detailed inconsistency variation and is straightforward for BMS implementation.

# Short-term abusive tests use a controlled SOC, deformation, and temperature matrix for feature extraction  
The study uses a matrix of short-term abusive conditions, including mechanical indentation depths of ~4–7 mm, overcharge levels of 110–140% SOC, over-discharge levels of −5% to −15% SOC, and low-temperature cycling at −10°C with 0.5C–1.5C rates. Each abuse case is repeated for 2–3 cycles using CC–CV charging with a small current cut-off to ensure repeatability and clear feature extraction. This matrix links specific parameter changes (depth, overcharge degree, C-rate, SOC range) to distinct MN/CCV signatures that can be used for retrieval and diagnosis in real packs.

# Combined effects of SOC, capacity, and resistance explain abused-cell inconsistency signatures  
Abusive behaviors such as overcharge, mechanical deformation, over-discharge, and low-temperature cycling primarily act by altering basic properties: initial SOC, usable capacity, internal resistance, and polarization resistance. Many complex voltage patterns—V-type and Λ-type MN shapes, sharp end-of-discharge falls, and progressive MN decline—can be interpreted as superpositions of SOC shift (horizontal movement), capacity change (curve stretch), and resistance change (vertical offset or ISC drain). As the magnitude of these combined variations increases, the corresponding inconsistency features in MN and CCV become more pronounced.

# Real battery pack inconsistency mainly arises from combined variations in basic properties  
In practical modules, voltage inconsistency is rarely dominated by a single parameter; instead, it typically stems from simultaneous cell-to-cell differences in SOC, capacity, and resistance (including OCV and polarization contributions). Manufacturing scatter, uneven thermal conditions, and localized aging all contribute to these combined deviations. Understanding and modeling how these basic property variations interact is crucial for interpreting observed voltage patterns and designing effective balancing and diagnostic strategies.

# Voltage inconsistency patterns separate design-induced heterogeneity from abusive behaviors  
Baseline manufacturing scatter in SOC, capacity, and resistance produces stable inconsistency patterns (e.g., fixed V/Λ-type MN shapes and nearly constant CCV over multiple cycles) that do not trend strongly with time. In contrast, abusive behaviors that introduce ISC, severe overcharge, or significant low-temperature damage generate distinctive signatures: continuous MN decline, rising CCV, and aggravated end-of-discharge deviations. These pattern differences enable separation of benign design heterogeneity from evolving, safety-relevant faults in field data.

# Subtle “V-type”, sharp-fall, and continuous-decline MN features are key fault-diagnostic markers  
The combination of V-type MN shape during charge, sharp MN fall at discharge end, and continuous MN decline with cycling is a powerful diagnostic signature of abused or anomalous cells. Mechanical deformation, overcharge, and low-temperature damage all reproduce versions of these features through different underlying property changes. Systematic extraction and tracking of such subtle MN patterns from pack voltage data can support early detection of minor faults before large, obvious deviations or safety incidents occur.

# Electrochemical mechanisms behind inconsistency motivate dynamic models and long-term studies  
Inconsistency from SOC deviation is closely linked to reaction kinetics and polarization: near SOC extremes, faster electrochemical reactions and stronger polarization lead to steeper voltage gradients, amplifying small SOC differences into large voltage deviations. Capacity loss and resistance growth are associated with side reactions (e.g., SEI/CEI growth and lithium consumption), while changes in polarization resistance can strongly affect inconsistency under dynamic current profiles and non-uniform temperature fields. The authors note that long-term abuse and realistic dynamic duty cycles are likely to produce more pronounced inconsistency, motivating future work using electrochemical and pack-level models for improved safety and degradation assessment.
